# archive a local copy of files before I make github commit changes

# cd to Projects directory

# make a folder to store archived / deep-copied files in

# before deep copy to archives, check out how large old folder is: 
ruby@rubyVM:~/Projects/ThinkLikeProgrammer$ du -sh .
54M	.

# make the archive: 
ruby@rubyVM:~/Projects/ThinkLikeProgrammer$ cd ../
ruby@rubyVM:~/Projects$ mkdir archives
ruby@rubyVM:~/Projects$ cp -a ./ThinkLikeProgrammer/ ./archives/TLAP_undo_file_change_commit

# after deep copy, verify that it worked by checking file size of archive: 
ruby@rubyVM:~/Projects$ du -sh archives/TLAP_undo_file_change_commit/
54M	archives/TLAP_undo_file_change_commit/

# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/448919/how-can-i-remove-a-commit-on-github

# don't erase sensitive data, just reorient branches on tree:

#no need to git stash: no dirty tree

# go back to relevant directory: 
ruby@rubyVM:~/Projects$ cd ./ThinkLikeProgrammer/


git reset --hard HEAD^ #goes back one commit and also syncs with local files

git push origin +master #assertive push (if i don't do this, my branch will look one commit behind of master)

===	===	===

# move my files around, but this time using git
