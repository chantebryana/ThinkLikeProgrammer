split integer up into elements of array

multiply every odd index of array (index 1, 3, 5, etc) by 2; save new array under new variable name

do something yet unknown to add together individual numbers with multiple digits (18 => 1+8, etc)

add up all elements of array to master number

divide master number by 10; if modulo = 0, then number passes test

added twist to solve the actual problem: program must process each character before reading the next one (my array solution won't work here -- or will it???)
